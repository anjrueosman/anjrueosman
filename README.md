- 👋 Hi, I’m @anjrueosman
- 👀 I’m interested in data science and machine learning!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to work with python data science libraries to clean and visualize data. Once I'm comfortable with that, I'm going to delve into machine learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any entry level data analysis work.
